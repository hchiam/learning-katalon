# Learning Katalon (Katalon Recorder)

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

It's like the [Selenium IDE](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-selenium-ide) Chrome extension, but a little easier to use. It also has more export options for different frameworks and readable code generation (instead of only exporting a JSON).
